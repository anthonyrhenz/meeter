# Powershell Syntax for Terminal Commands

When executing terminal commands, ensure they are compatible with Windows Powershell, as you are working on a Windows environment.

- Use Powershell syntax for all commands.
- For example, to list files, use `Get-ChildItem` or `ls`.
- To copy files, use `Copy-Item`.
- To delete files, use `Remove-Item`.
- To display file content, use `Get-Content`.
- When creating multi-line scripts or commands, use backticks (`) for line continuation if needed.
- To chain commands, use a semicolon (`;`). For example, `Get-ChildItem; Write-Host "Listed files"`.
